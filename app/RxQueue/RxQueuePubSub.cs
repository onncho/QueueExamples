//Rx implementation of Publisher/Subscriber
//Here, we have a single thread handling jobs, even if itâ€™s for 2 different handlers.
//We used .Publish() in _jobs.ObserveOn(Scheduler.Default).Publish() to create a connectable observable that shares a single subscription in the sequence. 
//Without this addition, each call to .Subscribe would create its own sequence with the scheduler creating their own pooled thread for each job type. In other words, we would have 2 different threads handling the queue, which would break the FIFO order.
